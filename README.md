Here you can find my own implementation of <i>[Snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre))</i> in R/[Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) with css and java script.

How play
--------

-   set level
-   start game - click play or use arrows
-   move snake using arrows

When you lose you will see your score and position.

Enjoy :)
